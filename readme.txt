The Loading Screen Modification adds a pop-up style translucent frame on the top of your website whenever the page is still loading. That box disappears when the page is loaded however.

[center][size=12pt][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size][/center]

Install this modification through the package manager. It only extracts one image file, and edits three other files, so nothing should go wrong. This may not work for themes other than the default, however. It has been tested on various themes and only one came up with an error, the others all worked.
